We need n numbers that add up to zero.

If n is even just take pairs like 1 and -1, 2 and -2, and so on. Every pair cancels out.

If n is odd do the same but in the end also put 0, so the total count becomes n.

Ex:

n = 4  [1, -1, 2, -2] sums to 0.

n = 5  [1, -1, 2, -2, 0]  sums to 0.

That’s it — pairs cancel and 0 is used only when needed.
