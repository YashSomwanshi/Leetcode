This solution uses the Dutch National Flag Algorithm to sort an array containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s (representing colors).
It maintains three pointers:

low: marks the boundary for 0s
mid: current element being checked
high: marks the boundary for 2s
How it works:

If nums[mid] == 0: swap with nums[low], increment both low and mid.
If nums[mid] == 1: just increment mid.
If nums[mid] == 2: swap with nums[high], decrement high (do not increment mid because the swapped value needs to be checked).
