I keep track of the lowest price seen so far (mini). As I go through the prices,
I calculate the profit Iâ€™d make if I sold on that day (prices[i] - mini).
If that profit is higher than my previous best, I update it. 
This way, I always know the maximum profit I could get by buying at the lowest price before selling
