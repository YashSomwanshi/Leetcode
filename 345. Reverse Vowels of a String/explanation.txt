Brute Force:
For each vowel from the start, I search for a vowel from the end and swap them. 
This keeps shrinking the search space. 
It works, but can be slow if there are many vowels.

Better Solution:
I collect all the vowels in a separate string, reverse that string,
and then replace the vowels in the original string with the reversed ones. 



Optimal Solution (Two Pointer):
I use two pointersâ€”one from the start and one from the end.
I move both pointers towards each other, swapping vowels when both pointers find them
